# Pick Things Up and Put Them Down

## Project Description

My app is a library of some of the most common exercises, for specific muscle groups. I've built an application where the user can comb through a variety of exercises, for each specific muscle group. As a user, they will also be able to add to the library themselves, if they so choose. It will include information about the workout and a video tutorial on how to properly perform the exercise.

**Technologies Used**

- ReactJS
- Javascript
- HTML
- CSS
- Bootstrap
- Python
- Django
- Django REST Framework

## Getting Started

- Open the application in a browser
- At the home page, you will be able to see the variety of muscle groups at the top. The specific muscle is highlighted in Red. 
- If you are interested in viewing a specific workout, for that muscle group,click the image of the specific body part. From there, you will be routed to that specific body part and a list of workouts.
- On the specific muscle page, the workouts are separated by difficulty. Click the specific workout, which will then route you to a page, describing the workout, along with a video tutorial. 
- If you would like to add a specific exercise, you can click “New Exercise” in the upper left hand corner, which will prompt you to add specific aspects that make up the workout.
- If you would like to edit an exercise, you can click on a specific exercise, which will take you to a new page. Once on the page, you would click, “Update”, prompting you to change any information you see fit(pun intended).
